This assignment is designed to read a list of trajectory data, to compute the total length of the trace, to compute	the	
length of the traceâ€™s longest segment, and	its	index in the trace, to compute the average sampling	rate for the trace 
and the	speed of each segment, and identify the	indices	of segments. 

The aim is to gain experience in comprehending	program requirements, designing	a small program, programming defensively 
and testing the program.
